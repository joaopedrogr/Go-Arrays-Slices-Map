# Go Arrays-Slices-Map

## ðŸ“˜ Description
The Go-Arrays-Slices-Map repository provides a comprehensive guide to working with arrays, slices, and maps in the Go programming language. This repository is perfect for developers looking to deepen their understanding of data structures in Go through practical examples and well-structured code snippets.

Key topics covered:

- Arrays: Learn how to declare, initialize, and manipulate arrays in Go.
- Slices: Understand dynamic arrays, their operations, and how to optimize performance.
- Maps: Explore key-value storage using Goâ€™s built-in map data structure.
- Iteration Techniques: Efficiently iterate over arrays, slices, and maps using for loops and range.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple sections for easy navigation and learning

### **Main Files**
### Arrays/
This folder contains examples showcasing Goâ€™s array structure:

- array.go: Basic declaration and manipulation of arrays.
- arrayinterno.go: Internal mechanics of arrays and their memory management.

### Slices/
This folder highlights the flexibility and efficiency of slices in Go:

- slice.go: Introduction to slices and their usage.
- slicemake.go: Using the make function to create slices dynamically.
- appendcopy.go: Demonstrates the append and copy functions for slice manipulation.

### Maps/
This folder provides examples of Goâ€™s map data structure:

- map1.go: Basic usage of maps in Go.
- map2.go: Advanced map operations and manipulations.
- mapaninhado.go: Example of nested maps for complex data structures.

### Iteration/
This section explains how to iterate over data structures effectively:

- forrange.go: Demonstrating the use of range in loops for arrays, slices, and maps.
